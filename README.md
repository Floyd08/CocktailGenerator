# CocktailGenerator

This is a simple passion project. I like programming and I like cocktails.

The simple goal of the app is to randomly generate cocktail recipes that are worth trying. I do this by drawing on my own knowledge about how to mix drinks, but I think it might be fun to have later versions rely on heuristics and machine learning. 

Currently the app has only a very primitive UI, so if you wish to use it you'll have to run it in the console. Long term I plan a proper UI and user profiles, so that the user might upload costume lists of ingredients that reflect what you have on hand at home
