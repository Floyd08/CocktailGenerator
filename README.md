# CocktailGenerator

This is a simple passion project. I like programming and I like cocktails.

The simple goal of the app is to randomly generate cocktail recipes that are worth trying. I do this by drawing on my own knowledge about how to mix drinks, but I think it might be fun to have later versions rely on heuristics and machine learning. 

The apps UI is a work in progress, but soon you'll be able to use the simplest functions iina webapp. Long term I plan to implement user profiles, so that the user might upload custom lists of ingredients that reflect what you have on hand at home, and then generate drinks based on what you have, instead of what is hardcoded in the master lists
