# CocktailGenerator

This is a simple passion project. I like programming and I like cocktails.

The simple goal of the app is to randomly generate cocktail recipes that are worth trying. I do this by drawing on my own knowledge about how to mix drinks, but I think it might be fun to have later versions rely on heuristics and machine learning. 

Currently you can try the app with a simple user interface here: http://18.191.37.210/CoGeneFrontEnd/

Next I plan to implement user profiles, so that the user might upload custom lists of ingredients that reflect what they have on hand at home, and then generate drinks based on these custom lists, instead of what is hardcoded in the master lists. The master lists will remain and be accessible via a "guest" profile. 

Features coming soon:
- Generate a drink from a template chosen at random
- Generate a drink from a template with at least one ingredient specifed by the user
- Generate a drink totally at random

Other features:
- Allow users to save, export, and share drinks they've generated
- Improve the quality of drinks that are generated by expanding ingredient attributes.
